After we have successfully installed all prerequisites, we will be able to access osTicket in the browser and will take us to this page. We can see that in the top right it says "admin panel". This tells us that we are currently on the "agent panel" but it gives us the option to switch to the agent panel.

<p>
When we click on the "admin panel", we are given more options to perform adminstrative duties and have the ability to assign roles to agents.

Here we are able to customize and assign roles for each agent.

We also have the ability to create departments and assign agents to their adequate departments.

<p>
Creating teams allows us to pull agents from different departments and group them together. This is especially helpful when only certain members of each department work on a specific project.

As an admin we can create agents (workers).

And as an agent we can create users (customers).

<p>
We can configure SLA plans to organize our tasks and determine how long a ticket is going to be opened. This is for the help desk administrator to have an idea of when a ticket is expected to be closed. We can organize our time frames such as above where we created "SEV-A, SEV-B, and SEV-C".

It is also helpful to be able to create "help topics" to help summarize what kind of problem we are going to work on.
